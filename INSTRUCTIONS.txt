What do we need?
1. A visually appealing and relevant image or video: 
This can be a photo or graphic that relates to the post and captures the attention of the viewer.

2. A well-written and engaging caption: This is the text that accompanies the post 
and should include a clear and compelling message that encourages engagement and interaction.

3. A call to action: This can be a button or link that directs the viewer to take a specific action, 
such as visiting a website or signing up for a newsletter, or to submit your comment, to like or share.

4. Hashtags: These are keywords that can be used to increase the visibility of the post 
and make it more discoverable to users searching for related content.

5. Metrics: A way for you to track engagement, likes, comments, shares, etc.

Responses: It's important to have a way for users to leave comments and feedback on the post, 
and a way for you to respond to those comments. Overall, a social media post page should be visually appealing, 
easy to read, and encourage engagement and interaction with the audience.
